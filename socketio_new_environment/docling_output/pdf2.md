You'll graduate with the practical leadership skills, applicable knowledge, and effective mindsets to transform your life and career.

## Be the best leader you can be

We've taken advanced self-awareness practices from leadership development courses and built them into all our degree programs. Armed with this insight and the systematic feedback of your peers, you'll work to improve the key skills you've identified and develop an authentic style of leadership that's uniquely you.

## Gain the digital skills the 21st century demands

Different specializations require different technological savvy but one thing's for certain-you need a strong digital skillset in today's workplace. Choose from a variety of specializations that will give you the knowledge and skills to succeed in a tech-driven business world.

## Make personal career connections

We work with every student individually to set a targeted career strategy and guide them on a clear path to achieve their career ambitions. With insider knowledge, local expertise, and years of experience on the job, our coaches work with you one-on-one, from day one. Make the most of the opportunity to connect with professionals across multiple locations and industries and you'll be in the strongest possible position come graduation.

## Built in Flexibility for Working Professionals

When you add graduate study to an already busy life, flexibility is a must. Hult's part-time MBA programs are designed to help you balance your studies with your other commitments. The degree adapts to your needs and is flexible enough to change if your life does.

## Flexible start dates

We have two intakes throughout the year, so you can start the program when it suits you best.

Classes take place over one long weekend per month, meaning minimal disruption to your work life.

## Mode of study

Our Executive MBA offers up to 100% on-campus classes with options available for online study, if needed.* Our Hybrid MBA caters for 50% on-campus classes and 50% online study.

## Never fall behind

If you miss a class for any reason, you can simply catch up at another time, or even at another campus.**

## Change campuses

In the summer months, customize your degree with electives at any of Hult's campus locations and, in special circumstances, change your home campus.

*  While Hult offers EMBA students the option to take core courses in an online format, this is to be used only as an alternative option for occasional circumstances when in-person attendance cannot be arranged.

Students typically complete the program in two years but you can pause the program and take up to four years to finish.
