# Lunch Menu

Fratellino in Italian means “little brother.” Welcome to the little brother’s restaurant, an homage to the older brothers’ teachings and support that inspired owner Cesar Lomeli to first venture out and create an Italian culinary experience in Orange County.

As a restaurant, we were the little brother of the community when we started in 2000, and with your support and patronage, we grew up to be the restaurant scrupulously committed to quality that you visit today.

Fratellino’s is our thanks to you and a continued promise to provide you mouthwatering food, diligent service, and not only a seat in our restaurant, but also a place in our family.

The Lomeli Family
