For Those Made to Do

You want an MBA that will give you a competitive edge in the rapidly 
changing global economy and future-proof your career. Hult’s MBA 
program has been designed to develop the skills most in demand in 
businesses worldwide so you can make an impact—in both corporate 
and entrepreneurial environments. You’ll graduate with the practical 
leadership skills, applicable knowledge, and effective mindsets to 
transform your life and career. 

Be the best leader you can be

It’s not until you actually lead a team of people that you understand the type of 
leader you are. We’ve taken advanced self-awareness practices from leadership 
development courses and built them into all our degree programs. Armed with 
this insight and the systematic feedback of your peers, you’ll work to improve the 
key skills you’ve identified and develop an authentic style of leadership that’s 
uniquely you. 

Gain the digital skills the 21st century demands

Different specializations require different technological savvy but one thing’s for 
certain—you need a strong digital skillset in today’s workplace. Choose from a 
variety of specializations that will give you the knowledge and skills to succeed 
in a tech-driven business world. 

Make personal career connections 

We work with every student individually to set a targeted career strategy and 
guide them on a clear path to achieve their career ambitions. With insider 
knowledge, local expertise, and years of experience on the job, our coaches 
work with you one-on-one, from day one. Make the most of the opportunity to 
connect with professionals across multiple locations and industries and you’ll be 
in the strongest possible position come graduation.

Built in Flexibility for 
Working Professionals

Never fall behind 
If you miss a class for any reason, you can 
simply catch up at another time, or even at 
another campus.** 

Go at your own pace 
Students typically complete the program in two years 
but you can pause the program and take up to four 
years to finish. 

When you add graduate study to an already busy life, flexibility is a 
must. Hult’s part-time MBA programs are designed to help you balance 
your studies with your other commitments. The degree adapts to your 
needs and is flexible enough to change if your life does. 

Change campuses 
In the summer months, customize your degree 
with electives at any of Hult’s campus locations 
and, in special circumstances, change your  
home campus.

Flexible start dates 
We have two intakes throughout the year, so you 
can start the program when it suits you best.

Weekend classes 
Classes take place over one long weekend  
per month, meaning minimal disruption to your 
work life. 

Mode of study
Our Executive MBA offers up to 100% on-campus 
classes with options available for online study,  
if needed.* Our Hybrid MBA caters for 50% 
on-campus classes and 50% online study.

The flexible EMBA program helps you 
balance competing demands on your 
time from other areas of life

* While Hult offers EMBA students the option to take core courses in an 
online format, this is to be used only as an alternative option for occasional 
circumstances when in-person attendance cannot be arranged.

applied in the workplace as well as to your own 
professional growth.
