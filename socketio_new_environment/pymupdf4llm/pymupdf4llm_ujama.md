### FRESH FOOD - KITCHEN AFRICAN HUMAN RHYTHM

To ensure the quality and goodness of our recipes we have chosen to use

only fresh and seasonal products.

With the true rhythm of life our cooks transform these gifts of nature, with respect and delicacy,

giving shape and flavor to delicious dishes.

Following this philosophy we can spend a few more minutes preparing the dishes but

you could take advantage of being together and sharing the emotions of your vacation.

#### Our food is made with love.
